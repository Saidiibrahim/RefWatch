# Architecture

RefWatch is a watch-first product with an iOS companion app, sharing core domain logic and services.

## Where To Read
- Canonical architecture index: `docs/design-docs/index.md`
- Core architectural beliefs: `docs/design-docs/core-beliefs.md`
- System breakdown: `docs/design-docs/architecture/overview.md`
- Platform details: `docs/design-docs/architecture/watchos.md` and `docs/design-docs/architecture/ios.md`
- Shared services: `docs/design-docs/architecture/shared-services.md`

## Working Rule
All architecture changes must update the relevant design doc and, when non-trivial, be tracked in an active exec plan under `docs/exec-plans/active`.
