title: Capture UX contract, catalog ordering, and permission handling
phase: Phase 1 - Experience Definition & Data Mapping
---

### Goals
- Document the exact list(s) of workouts to surface (quick starts, presets, history) and how they should appear in the carousel.
- Specify how authorization messaging, diagnostics, and empty states manifest without the old sectioned list.
- Clarify the required dwell duration and confirm whether the preview auto-starts a session or awaits an explicit action.
- Align on tactile/visual confirmation for dwell lock (e.g., haptic pulse) and capture acceptable Digital Crown thresholds with design.

### Deliverables
- Written UX notes appended to the plan’s Context/Plan sections if scope changes.
- Open questions flagged back to stakeholders/product for resolution.

### Exit Criteria
- Stakeholder-aligned acceptance notes captured in the plan’s Decision Log.
- Unanswered questions tracked in the plan before development proceeds.
