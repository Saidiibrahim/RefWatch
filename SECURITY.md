# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We provide security fixes for the latest release on the `main` branch.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| main    | Yes       |
| < 1.0   | No        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues via GitHub Security Advisories so the
maintainers can investigate privately. If you cannot use Security Advisories,
open a GitHub Issue and mark it as security-sensitive.

When reporting, include:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Potential impact
- Any suggested remediation, if you have one

## Response Timeline

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide a status update
within 7 days. We will coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline with the
reporter when appropriate.
