Always start with "Hey Ibby"

You are building a WatchOS app for football/soccer referees.
Every time you choose to apply one of the rules from the rules list below, specify the rule(s) you are applying.
You can abbreviate the rule description to a single word or phrase.

# Important rules you HAVE TO FOLLOW

# Swift specific rules

# 1. State management
- Use appropriate property wrappers and macros:
  - Annotate view models with '@Observable', e.g., '@Observable final class MyModel'.
  - Do not use @State in the SwiftUI View for view model observation. Instead, use 'Let model: MyModel'.
  - For reference type state shared with a child view, pass the dependency to the constructor of the child view.
  - For value type state shared with a child view, use SwiftUI bindings if and only if the child needs write access to the state.
  - For value type state shared with a child view, pass the value if the child view only needs read access to the state.
  - Use 'Environment' for state that should be shared throughout the entire app, or large pieces of the app.
  - Use '@State' only for local state that is managed by the view itself.
