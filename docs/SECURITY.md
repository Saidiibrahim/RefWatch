# SECURITY

Security baseline:
- Do not commit secrets or local credential files.
- Keep auth boundaries explicit across watchOS, iOS, and backend services.
- Prefer least-privilege data access and validate sensitive operations.
- Track security-relevant changes in exec plans and release notes.

Operational details and setup guidance live in `docs/references`.
