# Exec Plans Index

Execution plans and granular task files are the canonical workflow tracker for non-trivial changes.

## Structure
- Active work: `active/`
- Completed work: `completed/`
- Tech debt ledger: `tech-debt-tracker.md`

## Active Plans
- `active/match-timer-ux/PLAN_match-timer-ux.md`
- `active/mode-switcher-ux/PLAN_mode-switcher-ux.md`
- `active/substitution-nav/PLAN_substitution_nav.md`
- `active/watch-timer-readability/PLAN_watch-timer-readability.md`

## Completed Plans
- `completed/mode-switcher-navigation/PLAN_mode_switcher_navigation.md`
- `completed/reports/early-tester-issues-2025-12-02.md`
- `completed/reports/undo-event-bug-investigation-2025-12-02.md`

## Process Rule
Each active plan must have task files in the same directory and keep `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` current.
