# FRONTEND

Frontend implementation guidance for watchOS and iOS:
- Keep watch-first UX priorities explicit in `docs/product-specs`.
- Maintain MVVM boundaries and avoid platform leakage into shared code.
- Link UI changes to active exec plans in `docs/exec-plans/active`.
- Validate user-facing flows against product specs before merge.
