# RefWatch Documentation Hub

Welcome to the RefWatch knowledge base. This folder complements the generated API documentation in ``Documentation/RefWatch.docc`` and keeps project processes in one place.

## How to Use This Hub
- New developers: start with [Getting Started](getting-started/installation.md) and [Running the Apps](getting-started/running.md).
- Architects: review [System Overview](architecture/overview.md) plus platform specific breakdowns.
- Feature work: check the [Feature Guides](features/) before modifying flows.
- Release and contribution details live in [Process Docs](process/).
- Testing expectations are in [Testing Strategy](testing/strategy.md).

For API-level explanations and tutorials, build the DocC catalog (see `Documentation/RefWatch.docc`).
