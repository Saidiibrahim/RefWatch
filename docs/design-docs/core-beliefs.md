# Core Beliefs

1. Repository knowledge is the system of record.
2. Product specs define user intent; code and tests prove implementation.
3. Every complex change is tracked by a plan and explicit tasks.
4. Active plans are living documents and must reflect current reality.
5. Completed plans remain immutable historical context except for factual corrections.
6. Architecture docs explain boundaries, ownership, and integration contracts.
7. Generated docs (like DB schema snapshots) must cite source-of-truth inputs and regeneration steps.
8. Reliability, security, and quality scorecards are maintained continuously, not post hoc.
