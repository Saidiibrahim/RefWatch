# PRODUCT_SENSE

RefWatch is watch-first for in-match referee execution, with iOS as a complementary planning, analysis, and post-match surface.

Prioritize:
1. Fast, low-friction in-match interactions on watchOS.
2. Reliability and recoverability during active sessions.
3. Clear cross-platform continuity without duplicating responsibilities.

Canonical feature intent lives in `docs/product-specs`.
